# Anonymous Academic Peer Review

A revolutionary blockchain-based academic peer review system utilizing Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology to ensure complete privacy and anonymity in scholarly evaluation processes.

## üéØ Core Concepts

### FHE-Based Anonymous Academic Review
This system implements a cutting-edge approach to academic peer review using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** through the Zama protocol. Unlike traditional review systems where reviewers' evaluations can be traced back to individuals, our platform ensures that:

- **Complete Anonymity**: Reviewer identities remain permanently encrypted and untraceable
- **Confidential Evaluations**: All review scores and recommendations are encrypted on-chain
- **Tamper-Proof Records**: Blockchain immutability ensures review integrity
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics**: Statistical analysis possible without revealing individual reviews

### Privacy-First Paper Evaluation
The system addresses critical issues in academic publishing:

- **Bias Elimination**: Anonymous reviews reduce personal and institutional bias
- **Honest Feedback**: Reviewers can provide candid evaluations without fear of retaliation
- **Transparent Process**: Blockchain provides verifiable submission and review timeline
- **Self-Review Prevention**: Smart contract logic prevents authors from reviewing their own papers

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Features

### Encrypted Review System
- **FHE-Protected Scores**: Quality ratings (1-4 scale) encrypted using Zama's FHE library
- **Confidential Recommendations**: Accept/reject decisions stored as encrypted booleans
- **Selective Disclosure**: Only paper authors can decrypt their received reviews
- **Immutable History**: All encrypted reviews permanently stored on blockchain

### Smart Contract Security
- **Author Protection**: Automatic prevention of self-review attempts
- **Duplicate Prevention**: One review per paper per reviewer enforced
- **Access Control**: Encrypted data only accessible to authorized parties
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Secure against common smart contract vulnerabilities
